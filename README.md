## 1. my_project
I'm working on text mining of postings in my school's online community 'seodam'.
- In seodam, users can click 'freeze' button for a posting if one thinks the posting is inappropriate(e.g. humilliating others, using swear words etc)
- I collected about 3,000 postings that were 'frozen' by users and another 3,000 that weren't
- I encoded postings by BOW method and used Multinomial Naive Beyes model for prediction
- I'm trying different models to find out the best performing model
